It's beautiful, it's deep, and it will snatch away your time as you delve deep into the abyss of blockchains. But what does "on-chain analysis" mean in simple English terms?

On-chain analysis is basically analyzing public blockchains to get data interesting to us. For example, I can open etherscan and look at allllll the transactions on Ethereum. That's the beauty of most blockchains - they are all public for anyone to see, free of charge! 

In crypto, people in general do on-chain analysis to track whales or smart money wallets. The latter means traders with insider intel or great trading skills, thus the name "smart money". If you use a sniper bot that copies trades, you can search for wallets that have positive track record of trading and copy trade them. For non-snipers, on-chain data helps to track insiders, so you buy the same stuff or get an idea about a good time to sell.

For the past couple of days, I have been collecting a list of whales that are involved in a token I've been DCA-ing on Arbitrum. I saw that one of those whales has bought about 60,000 USD worth of this token today. This gives me the hint that he's adding more to his bag: maybe he has intel (?). As for the rest of the whales on my list, they have been DCA buying for a few weeks at the current price more or less. This indicates to me that it's a good time for me too to DCA.

Alternatively, if you see top whales selling or moving their crypto to exchanges, it could indicate it's time to exit too. Nothing is set in stone, the token can dump or pump afterward, but it gives us a good idea about what the gigantic market makers are doing.

This could be frustrating or a slightly difficult learning curve, especially if someone doesn't know how to read blockchain data on arbiscan, etherscan and the such. However, once you really start digging deep, a new world opens up to you, you start witnessing what all these millionaires and billionaires are doing, and it's fascinating I tell you. Imagine if you could see live what Janet Yellen is buying, or Elon Musk, or maybe Ray Dalio or Munger. On-chain analysis is exclusive for crypto, and it's beautiful.
