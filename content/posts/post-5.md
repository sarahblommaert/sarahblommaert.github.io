Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had a speech on February 1st regarding the interest rates and the Fed's outlook on future rates, as well as other interesting points. 

Interest rate was raised by 25bp, instead of the 50bp that had been projected end of 2022. This lower raise was due to consistent lower inflation data. Powell made it clear that the Fed won't raise interest rates aggressively as long as inflation is under control and keeps going down; they still aim for the 2% inflation end-goal. 

Moreover, Powell advised to increase the US debt ceiling as well, which I (and the market) was pretty content about.

All in all, this news is nicely bullish for the crypto market, and BTC reacted accordingly:

When Powell started the speech, BTC rose a bit, then when Powell mentioned that the Fed **WILL** increase rates as needed if inflation goes up again, BTC started to dump and wicked to 22780 USD before rising up so fast as the news started to turn bullish. Powell said as long as inflation is down, rates will continue to decline. Great news right!?

Also regarding the debt ceiling, the US democrats and liberals are in a disagreement at the moment, but a raise in the ceiling is inevitable; they have millions of Americans to pay! Imagine, all public workers, veterans, people with disabilities and so much more will not receive their money if the US doesn't raise the ceiling. 

What does debt ceiling raise mean for crypto?

Yes. The US will print more money if the ceiling is raised. We saw what happened during covid when countries all around the world printed lots of money, all the markets went berserk.

Does this mean bull run is back? Maybe not yet, no one knows. As I mentioned earlier, inflation data matters a lot and it'll affect rate increase. 

What I always advise is DCA and only invest what you are comfortable losing or sleeping on for a long period of time. 

Happy trading!
