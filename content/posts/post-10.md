How do you know when to sell? What's the right time or target?
 There is none, no one can time the bottom or top perfectly. Good traders learn to set different targets and a stop loss to remove the emotional aspect of trading. 

A **stop loss** (SL) order is one where if your token falls to a certain target, an auto-sell is triggered. So let's say you're longing BTC at $17000, but you do not tolerate more than 5% loss, you can set a stop loss at about $16158 (I avoid round numbers or psychologically comfortable numbers as many traders set targets there and your order might not fill, so $16158 would be a better target than $16150, $16000 etc.). 

Stop loss can also be extremely beneficial when you are in profit, but you want to protect your trade from going into the negative. So you longed at $17000 and BTC is now $18000, you put your stop loss in the positive, so if BTC rugs, you don't get liquidated/fall at a loss again. The SL would depend on your tolerance: maybe you tolerate a 5% change, maybe 10% price change in BTC, really up to you. With more volatile assets, the tolerance would be greater, while with less volatile ones, the tolerance can be tighter. 

So if I bought a meme token on Ethereum, I can tolerate a 30% price change, while on BTC I wouldn't. 

**Trailing stop loss** means the SL price target moves as the price of your asset moves. You bought at $17000, and as BTC moves up, the price at which your sell order will trigger moves algorithmically with the BTC. This option is offered by exchanges and certain trade bots on-chain. So for example, you longed $17000 and BTC is now $20000, your SL moved up to $19020-ish, and so on and so forth. Note stop loss is a good practice not just with leverage trading, but even spot trading.

*The upward price movement is marked with a black line. A trailing stop loss price is set at a fixed distance below the price.Notice how the trailing stop loss moves automatically behind the price at a distance. When the price touches the trailing stop, the transaction is closed automatically. Note that the trader's profit is the distance between the trade opening level (1) and the trailing trigger price (5).; source: https://www.litefinance.org*

This method helps you keep holding a coin to reach higher prices, especially as a coin is getting very hyped and moving fast upwards. However, most importantly, trailing stop loss makes sure you do not incur big losses, or that you lose your profit. Helps a lot remove emotions which is the greatest struggle a trader experiences.

I hope this helped, till later!
