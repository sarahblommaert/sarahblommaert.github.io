Is it a scam? Will I lose all my hard earned money? Some would argue that yes it is a scam and you would lose it all, others would argue it isn't and you will make life changing money. Let's discuss this further:

Anyone can create a token, having an appealing website and great utility, pay for marketing, get lots of hype, only to rug and make many lose their money. There's lots of people like that in crypto, but with regulation, we will weed them out. 

Keep in mind, Ponzis and exit scams exist in all sectors, not just cryptocurrency. 

One notorious financial scandal is the Wirecard fraud. It was a German payment processor and financial service provider that lasted for over 2 decades and was listed in the German DAX. Till to this day, almost 2 billion euros are still missing[^1].

Many have heard of the Ponzis in cryptocurrency, like Luna, OneCoin or Bitconnect. People panic when they see the charts during a bear market, and after hearing all their friends losing lots of money buying the tops, they shy out and call crypto a SCAM.

Bitcoin is -64% on the 1-Year frame (from January 3, 2022 to January 3, 2023). It held better than Spotify (-65%) or Snapchat (-80%) which are well known businesses. Just to point out, **all** assets carry risk, and buying tops carries (unrealized) loss.

Cryptocurrency isn't necessarily evil or scammy, it's the people behind many projects that commit frauds. Nowadays, a number of people in Third World countries rely on trustless bankless crypto transactions after their governments and banks proved their incompetency. In First World countries, some big companies are adopting blockchain technology and supporting startups that incorporate it to solve real life problems, while others use it to surf on the hype and get "free" marketing from the crypto community.

Just like everything in life, there is the good, the bad, the bad in the good, and the good in the bad.

During December 2022, the Luxembourg Blockchain Lab and the Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Initiative made a call for startups in Luxembourg that combine blockchain technology with Sustainable Development Goals[^2]. I personnally got the pleasure to chat with a lawyer who was looking to incorporate blockchain in the law firm she's working at. The options are endless. 

Do people expect to buy the tops and make lots of money? Bitcoin to the moon? 100k incoming? And then cry after selling at -90%. You see my point here, buying the top of anything, whether stocks or crypto when following a mania, WILL indeed result in massive loss of money.

Now it's your chance anon, it's the bear market, everything is down, and the opportunity to buy now and make possible profit is better than when Bitcoin was at 60k.
  
Stick to projects you believe in, ones the team is working hard, ones you did your research about and liked their vision. 

And please, for the love of all what's cute and sweet in this world (like my little bunny), don't invest life savings and don't invest money that's not yours.

Peace and blessings.
