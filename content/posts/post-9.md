I have been in crypto since 2019, and I can tell you that each day I learn something new. However, some of the biggest lessons I learned are the following:

## 1) Be prepared for both, the bull AND the bear

I learned this the hard way, I guess. This advice basically means to keep holding crypto in case the market does go up, but to also have stables reserves to buy in the bear or during dips when they happen.
As a matter of fact, I still hold some of the BTC I bought under $5,000, and I have sold a chunk when BTC closed under the bull market support band in 2021. I am still buying crypto to anticipate for the bullrun thanks to money I made from the bull!

## 2) Remember to take profit

The money isn't truly yours till you cash out. Let's say you made $100,000... no! you didn't make 100k! not unless you cashed out that is ;) you get my point. It's best of course to cash out for fiat, but stables are also *fine*. 

## 3) Stay calm before a stressful trade

USDC had a big depeg March 2023 right when I was traveling :D and a considerable chunk of my networth was in USDC. I remember seeing USDC had depegged to under 80 cents and all over social media people were saying it's going to zero, another Terra USD catastrophe. On first instinct, we get fired up by all the FUD and we react with panic selling. But nah, I've been through this shi& for so long, I won't bulge in this time. I took some deep breaths and started doing proper reseach about the situation. By the time I was doing so, USDC had risen to 83 cents or so. 

**After my research I gave myself a limit:**

if it falls under 75 cents I will cut my loss and sell. However, chances were it will recover according to my research. It was a Saturday, and banks in the US didn't open till Sunday (it was a bankrun drama). The USDC mother company gave a reassuring statement Sunday if I remember correctly, and luckily Monday they released an official statement that all was going to be fine

## 4) Go against the flow, seriously

I think my best crypto strategy has been to do against what the majority are doing, so going against the common sentiment. When BTC was $15-16k, I was buying! And in 2021 when everyone was screaming "$100k incoming", I was DCA selling! :) You see, when it comes to trading, go against the flow, easier said than done. Start practicing now, build and train in the bear, it will pay off a lot in the bull ;)

Good luck!
