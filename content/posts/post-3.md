To cut to the chase, no one exactly knows for sure, and anyone that tells you otherwise is bluffing. 

Let's discuss when one can **expect** or speculate a new bull market instead:

The cryptocurrency market has been following a 4-year cycle for the past decade. Bitcoin had 3 bull market years which are 2013, 2017, and 2021. In general, we have 3 years of bear market and 1 year of bull market, the latter usually following the Bitcoin halving year. Does that mean 2025 will be the year when Bitcoin rises again? Perhaps we can anticipate that.

This bear market is a bit different since it's the first time Bitcoin experiences a recession (yay). So no one can pinpoint how the coin will react. Thus, I am looking at macroeconomics and basing my expectations on that. 

The US Federal Reserve (Fed) plans to continue raising interest rates throughout 2023. On February first, the Fed has a meeting to discuss interest rates; we can expect a 25 or 50 bp rate hike [^1]. The Fed awaits 
considerable evidence and data that inflation is slowing down before easing on the interest rates. But wait, why are interest rates relevant to Bitcoin? Well in simple terms, when governments' central banks raise interest rates, investors withdraw money from the stock market (and cryptocurrency) and put it instead in bonds. 

Basically:

Higher interest rates=less purchasing power=enterprises have to lower the cost=inflation goes down. 

So until inflation goes down more, we can expect the Fed will keep the interest rates high. Some economists, however, expect that the interest rate may start to lower in 2024 [^2]. In the photo below, we see a table from the Fed's December FOMC meeting. It is projected that interest rates will peak in 2023 and then start to decrease in 2024.

So one can live on hopium that 2025 will be another bull year. I'm personally hopeful about it, and I'm very excited!

Are you ready, anon?
