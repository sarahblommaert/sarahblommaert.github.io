Hi there! My name is Sarah and I am a 26 year old professional with a strong background in cryptocurrency, fintech and personal finance. I have always been interested in the world of finance and technology, which is what initially drew me to the field of cryptocurrency.

Over the past 4 years, I have dedicated myself to learning as much as I can about the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. I have achievements and vast qualifications in this field and am constantly seeking out new opportunities to further my knowledge and expertise.

Some of my cryptocurrency experiences includes macrocap and microcap token/coin trading, technical analysis, onchain sniping, using bots and tools for trading, safety advice, community management, token marketing and many more!

As a financial advisor and cryptocurrency educator and trader, I am responsible for constantly following up with the newest innovations, as well as preparing courses based on YOUR expertise level and teaching you in the most fun and engaging way possible. This way, learning about cryptocurrency does not seem boring or difficult.I am passionate about using my skills and expertise to help drive the adoption and mainstream use of cryptocurrency.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest developments in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, as well as participating in online communities and events related to this field. I love working out and reading books. Thank you for visiting my "about me" section! I hope you have learned a little bit about my background and my passion for cryptocurrency.
