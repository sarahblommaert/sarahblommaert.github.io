What&amp;rsquo;s the right time or target? There is none, no one can time the bottom or top perfectly. Good traders learn to set different targets and a stop loss to remove the emotional aspect of trading.
A stop loss (SL) order is one where if your token falls to a certain target, an auto-sell is triggered. So let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re longing BTC at $17000, but you do not tolerate more than 5% loss, you can set a stop loss at about $16158 (I avoid round numbers or psychologically comfortable numbers as many traders set targets there and your order might not fill, so $16158 would be a better target than $16150, $16000 etc.</description></item><item><title>Valuable Tips I learned Over The Years</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-9/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 18:06:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-9/</guid><description>I have been in crypto since 2019, and I can tell you that each day I learn something new. However, some of the biggest lessons I learned are the following:
1) Be prepared for both, the bull AND the bear I learned this the hard way, I guess. This advice basically means to keep holding crypto in case the market does go up, but to also have stables reserves to buy in the bear or during dips when they happen.</description></item><item><title>Ethereum and LSD's</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 19:50:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-8/</guid><description>Happy Ethereum Upgrade! Finally, the anticipated Shapella upgrade happened on April 12th.
What is the Shapella upgrade? It&amp;rsquo;s 2 upgrades that happened at once: Shanghai and Capella. This upgrade aims to reduce energy consumption, and now finally stakers can withdraw their staked ETH. Since December 2020, people were willing to stake their ETH even without knowing when they could get back their stake. If you believed that much in ETH back then when unstaking seemed light years away, maybe even never coming, imagine now after this good news.</description></item><item><title>Some updates about the market: Arbitrum, Fed, Bitcoin</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 16:08:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-7/</guid><description>Arbitrum Ecosystem Arbitrum foundation announced the long awaited airdrop. To check if you are eligible, go to the OFFICIAL WEBSITE: https://arbitrum.foundation/ Please beware of scams! Expected price is about $1 per token, juicy. I&amp;rsquo;m anticipating post-launch dump (hopefully, like with $OP) to snatch up a bag of $ARB. I expect it would do well in the next couple of years, especially if it follows the performance of $OP. Note that Arbitrum is more hyped than Optimism, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be exciting.</description></item><item><title>On-Chain Analysis: Into The Depth of DeFi</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 21:03:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-6/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, it&amp;rsquo;s deep, and it will snatch away your time as you delve deep into the abyss of blockchains. But what does &amp;ldquo;on-chain analysis&amp;rdquo; mean in simple English terms?
On-chain analysis is basically analyzing public blockchains to get data interesting to us. For example, I can open etherscan and look at allllll the transactions on Ethereum. That&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of most blockchains - they are all public for anyone to see, free of charge!</description></item><item><title>Happy Powell, Happy Market</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 18:24:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-5/</guid><description>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had a speech on February 1st regarding the interest rates and the Fed&amp;rsquo;s outlook on future rates, as well as other interesting points.
Interest rate was raised by 25bp, instead of the 50bp that had been projected end of 2022. This lower raise was due to consistent lower inflation data. Powell made it clear that the Fed won&amp;rsquo;t raise interest rates aggressively as long as inflation is under control and keeps going down; they still aim for the 2% inflation end-goal.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin back to $23k! What's been happening?</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 21:10:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-4/</guid><description>Bitcoin ranged for about 7 weeks in the $15k to $17k range. I remember back then everyone and their cats were screaming &amp;ldquo;8k Bitcoin coming!!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;3k is the bottom&amp;rdquo;. You know when sentiment is that negative, to buy buy buy! Cheers to everyone that managed to go against the flow and do so.
But what now, how did Bitcoin go to 23k so fast? Two things to look for: funding rate and Binance futures orders.</description></item><item><title>Wen Bull?</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 16:06:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-3/</guid><description>To cut to the chase, no one exactly knows for sure, and anyone that tells you otherwise is bluffing.
Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss when one can expect or speculate a new bull market instead:
The cryptocurrency market has been following a 4-year cycle for the past decade. Bitcoin had 3 bull market years which are 2013, 2017, and 2021. In general, we have 3 years of bear market and 1 year of bull market, the latter usually following the Bitcoin halving year.</description></item><item><title>Is cryptocurrency a scam?</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 20:00:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/posts/post-2/</guid><description>Is it a scam? Will I lose all my hard earned money? Some would argue that yes it is a scam and you would lose it all, others would argue it isn&amp;rsquo;t and you will make life changing money. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss this further:
Anyone can create a token, having an appealing website and great utility, pay for marketing, get lots of hype, only to rug and make many lose their money.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 20:23:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sarahblommaert.com/about/</guid><description>Hi there!
