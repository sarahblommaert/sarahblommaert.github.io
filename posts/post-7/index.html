To check if you are eligible, go to the OFFICIAL WEBSITE: <a href=https://arbitrum.foundation/>https://arbitrum.foundation/</a>
Please beware of scams! Expected price is about $1 per token, juicy. I&rsquo;m anticipating post-launch dump (hopefully, like with $OP) to snatch up a bag of $ARB. I expect it would do well in the next couple of years, especially if it follows the performance of $OP. Note that Arbitrum is more hyped than Optimism, it&rsquo;s going to be exciting.</p><p>Airdrop will take place March 23rd. Another thing I expect is the ARB ecosystem pumping with this hype, especially close to the airdrop date. At the moment, I am eyeing a few tokens in that ecosystem. A lot of Arbitrum tokens pumped hard following the news, so it&rsquo;s good to be patient and DCA in, especially at retracement, NFA. Radiant Protocol, Dopex, GMX, GNS and Camelot are some interesting projects to note of.</p><h2 id=fed-whats-next>Fed: What&rsquo;s next?</h2><p>March 22 is going to be a big and volatile day. We have the FOMC meeting and interest rates. At the moment of writing this post, the expected hike is 25bp. Some think the Fed will pause hiking, but it seems less likely as the FOMC has some strong hawks that don&rsquo;t want to back down yet. Plus, with the recently announced <a href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bank-term-funding-program.htm>Bank Term Funding Program</a>, a pivot can be delayed. What does all this jargon mean? Blablabla big words, it basically means the Fed will assist banks that are in dire need of liquidity; they want to avoid a domino effect of banks collapsing. Why are they collapsing? Because they hire greedy people who mismanage situations. The rising interest rates are hurting some banks who truly messed up. The below tweet explains more in detail what happened to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).</p><p><img src=/images/jamie-tweet.jpg alt="Explanation of what happened to Silicon Valley Bank and why they collapsed">
<em>Tweet from Jamie Quint explaining in brief the situation at SVB and what lead to their collapse; source: <a href=https://twitter.com/jamiequint/status/1633956163565002752>https://twitter.com/jamiequint/status/1633956163565002752</a></em></p><h2 id=bitcoins-pump>Bitcoin&rsquo;s Pump</h2><p>Following the USDC fiasco, BTC is up again (yay) but what&rsquo;s now? Are we in a bull or still in the bear? Well, the economic situation in the world is still turbulent and there is lots of uncertainty. Nothing is clear yet, and the fed hasn&rsquo;t stopped with the rates. Technically, we are still in a bear, but depends on who you ask. It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway, what matters is recognizing that volatility is still a given and rates are ongoing. Some expect a dump when the fed pivots, as per history (stocks usually rallied during the hikes and dumped hard at the pivot). It is Bitcoin&rsquo;s first ever hike/pivot scenario and this year stocks dumped at rate hikes, does this mean we will pump at pivot? Hmm interesting thought indeed!</p><p><img src=/images/fed-pivot.jpg alt="What has happened when the fed pivoted in the past? Stocks crashed on average 28% after the first rate cut within an average of 14 months">

You&rsquo;re almost always going to end up selling too early or too late. Or pass on aping into a project that goes 1000x (which is okay cause you probably would have sold at 2x anyways ;)).
Accept that everyone in crypto has a story about how they bought XYZ coin real cheap and sold it before it mooned 100x. Almost everyone has a story about how they missed
out on becoming a millionaire, and you&rsquo;re no different.
Be okay with your past mistakes. Don&rsquo;t dwell on them even though they could be painful. Instead, learn from them and focus your attention on current and future opportunities.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>-<a href=https://defichads.medium.com/how-to-exit-your-positions-without-regrets-f23550e272fa>Defi Chads</a></p><p>Enjoy your days, Spring is coming!
