Finally, the anticipated Shapella upgrade happened on April 12th.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-shapella-upgrade>What is the Shapella upgrade?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s 2 upgrades that happened at once: Shanghai and Capella. This upgrade aims to reduce energy consumption, and now finally stakers can withdraw their staked ETH. Since December 2020, people were willing to stake their ETH even without knowing when they could get back their stake. If you believed that much in ETH back then when unstaking seemed light years away, maybe even never coming, imagine now after this good news. Some expected a price dump at these levels, but a big chunk of the staked ETH was at a loss (price about $1900 as in the photo below) so they held for long, why uninvest now? Keep in mind though that people are withdrawing in a queue system of a bit over 57,600 ETH per day, and it&rsquo;s not all unlocked at once <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. So we might or might not dump, but I&rsquo;m buying if we do!</p><p><img src=/images/staked-eth.jpg alt="ETH supply that was deposited during the peak bull run">
<em>ETH supply that was deposited during the peak bull run between mid-2021 and mid-2022 as seen in the image is staked at an unrealized loss or breakeven. Current price of 1 ETH is $2013; source: glassnode</em></p><h2 id=lsds-no-not-the-drugs>LSD&rsquo;s (no, not the drugs!)</h2><p>Liquid Staking Derivatives. In brief, it&rsquo;s a new concept whereby stakers can earn rewards from platforms while also having ETH staked. So your ETH is staked on one hand, and you have tokenized versions of that ETH on the other hand that you can earn interest from too!
As shown in the below image, you stake your ETH with a certain project, let&rsquo;s say Rocket Pool, Frax or Lido, and then you get a tokenized version of that ETH.</p><p><img src=/images/lsd.jpg alt="LSD liquid staking derivatives for Lido">
<em>ETH supply that was deposited during the peak bull run between mid-2021 and mid-2022 as seen in the image is staked at an unrealized loss. About half of the total stake amount is now held at breakeven or slightly higher (current price of 1 ETH is $2013); source: <a href=https://blog.cryptostars.is/>https://blog.cryptostars.is/</a></em></p><p>I hope this gave a little update on the main Ethereum events!
