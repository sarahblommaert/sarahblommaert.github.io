I remember back then everyone and their cats were screaming &ldquo;8k Bitcoin coming!!&rdquo; or &ldquo;3k is the bottom&rdquo;. You know when sentiment is that negative, to buy buy buy! Cheers to everyone that managed to go against the flow and do so.</p><p>But what now, how did Bitcoin go to 23k so fast? Two things to look for: funding rate and Binance futures orders.</p><h2 id=funding-rates>Funding Rates</h2><p>Funding rates were -0.1% before the pump began. This means speculators were very bearish, and there were more people shorting than longing. Short traders pay the long traders (and vice versa), this is very important, we will come to this in a bit. In crypto there isn&rsquo;t proper regulation like in the stock market, so manipulation is very common and happens all the time, whether a token has $1billion market cap or $5k. Exchanges and market makers are notorious for liquidity hunting (or stop loss hunting), which means they target the people leveraging and go opposite to what the majority of speculators are betting on; they &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; the money! Here we come back to what I said earlier: all the shorters for the past week have been paying the longers. Funding rate is public knowledge, and exchanges liquidate their own users to gain money.</p><p>In short, avoid leverage! I have many sad stories of people I know that lost 6 figures or a few million dollars leveraging. Don&rsquo;t let that be you!</p><p><img src=/images/stop-loss-hunting.jpg alt="Stop loss hunting">
<em>The little fish are the average retail users who are targeted by big market players for their stop loss; source: Mario Ulric</em></p><h2 id=binance-futures>Binance Futures</h2><p>There is a bot on Telegram that tracks unusual activity in Bitcoin; we saw lots of that on Binance. From January 11 we started seeing $400 million and above, though the days before we saw some activity between $100m and $300m. Let me show you in the picture above what I mean.</p><p><img src=/images/bitcoin-sniper-1.jpg alt="Bitcoin sniper bot tracking unusual activity">
<em>Binance futures huge market orders; source: Telegram <a href=https://t.me/BitcoinSniper>https://t.me/BitcoinSniper</a></em></p><p>These orders then trigger all sorts of exchange trading bots to buy and crypto start to pump! Nice right?</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t stop there. The market makers continued to pump and started playing with even bigger sums of money: $1.5 billion, $1.72 billion, $1.15 billion and the latest being $973 million on January 20. See the picture below.

<em>Binance futures recent huge market orders on January 17 and 20, 2023; source: Telegram <a href=https://t.me/BitcoinSniper>https://t.me/BitcoinSniper</a></em></p><p>Whoever was making these orders enjoyed very well shorter money.</p><p>So we learned 2 things from this post:</p><ol><li>go against retail sentiment (example: when Bitcoin was 15k-16k, buy time!!)</li><li>avoid leverage</li></ol><p>Till next time, anon! Stay safe trading :)</p><p><em>Disclaimer: I cannot prove nor disprove manipulation by Binance, this is all my speculation.</em></p></div><div class=post__footer></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer__base"><ul class=footer__list><li class=footer__item>&copy;
